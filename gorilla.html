                            <h3>GORILA</h3>
    <p>Although there are many types og gorillas, in our zoo we have the eastern gorilla. The Eastern gorilla is the largest primate in the world. As compared with other gorillas, the Eastern gorilla has smaller nose, shorter arms, longer hair as well as larger jaws and teeth. Mature males are often called silverbacks due to a large patch of hair on their backs, which is silver of grey in color. In addition, males have sharp and large canine teeth. When under stress, apocrine glands in the armpits of females emit a strong smell. The arms of Eastern gorilla are long and muscular, head is huge and legs are short. The silky and long coat of this primate varies from blue-black to brownish grey.</p>
     <p>They are diurnal, spending 40% of the day resting, 30% travelling and another 30% - feeding. They rest and sleep in nests, placed on steep slopes, in trees or on the ground. Eastern gorillas gather in social units called harems, which contain a male and females with their young. Gorilla harems are not territorial, though conflicts and encounters can happen, particularly when a lone male gets into contact with members of the harem. Grooming is a common activity for these gorillas, usually occurring between males and females as well as among females. These animals are very calm, careful to their babies, forming strong bonds within the group. Eastern gorillas use a wide variety of communication forms, interacting with each other or warning intruders to keep away.</p>
   <p>Eastern gorillas are folivores, feeding mainly upon leaves, roots, stems, vines, shrubs, bamboo as well as pith of herbs. They also consume flowers, fruit, berries, fungi, wood, bark of trees and epithelium, which is stripped from roots. In addition, these primates will sometimes eat invertebrates.</p>
